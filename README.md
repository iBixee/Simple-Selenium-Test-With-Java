# Simple-Selenium-Test-With-Java
A Java program that uses Selenium WebDriver to open a web browser, navigate to a website, and perform a simple test by checking the page title.

Make sure you have the Selenium WebDriver dependencies set up in your project, and you have the appropriate WebDriver executable for your chosen browser 
(e.g., ChromeDriver) installed and configured.

This is a basic example of a Selenium test, and you can expand it to perform more complex tests and interactions with web elements as needed. 
Remember to add proper exception handling for more robust test scripts.
